# Graphics Physics Engine

This is a very unfinished 3D games engine I am currently working on. The code might be a little messy until I get around to properly cleaning it. In theory it can handle multiple physics collisions, render multiple objects and is component-based. Currently the only existing component is a physicsObj (Rigidbody) component, but this can be expanded.
